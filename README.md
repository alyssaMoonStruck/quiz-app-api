## Planning Story

My third full-stack project is here! Feeling nostalgic I decided to do another  game in honor of my first ever project! Using all of the tools and knowledge
I have gathered through each each course I plan to handle every bug that comes
up with problem solving thinking, reffer to past resourses and work hard to find
new methods to solve each issue. Using an Express API template I will be coding with my favorite framework React for the main of my project. I will be using 
Heroku and MongoDB for deployment use the server side to hold all of the entered 
questions. I will make sure all authentication is working properly and then get 
started making my quiz! I will make sure I can allow my app to GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE resources so the user may create, read, edit and delete any questions
they would like after successfully signing up and signing in. I will be using React Hooks and Components for my front end, Bootstrap for cards and buttons and
SCSS for styling. I wil be taking things slow, following my schedule and will be 
sure to reach out for help as well as reffer to my resources whenever stuck, all
to make sure I complete this project on time and working wonderfully!
